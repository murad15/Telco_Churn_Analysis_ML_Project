# Telco_Churn_Analysis_ML_Project

The Telco customer churn data contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service.

**The data set includes information about**:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents


**The goal of this project is to:**

- Check and clean data
- Conduct the exploratory data analysis to understand the behavior of customers
- Build an ML model capable of accurately predicting the churn probability based of characteristics
